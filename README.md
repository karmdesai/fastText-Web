# fastTextWeb

[fastText](https://fasttext.cc) is a library provided by Facebook, Inc. for efficient text classification and representation learning. It's great for creating highly accurate text classification models in a short period of time. However, it can't easily be used to serve predictions on the web - **fastTextWeb** aims to solve this issue. The project was compiled into JavaScript using Emscripten and can be run using Node.
